# HowFastDoYouType
Coded a program to check how fast you are typing. Got the idea from 10fastfingers and wanted to see if i could code the same thing with c#

There might be some simplifications in my codes, I'm a beginner with C# so if you have any remarks or corrections please do let me know!
I don't know how to make a responsive panel in Windows Form so the panel where words appear sometimes look bad, sorry about that
